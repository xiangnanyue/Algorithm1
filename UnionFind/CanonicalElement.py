"""
Union-find with specific canonical element. 
Add a method find() to the union-find data type so that find(i) returns the largest element 
in the connected component containing ii. 
The operations, union(), connected(), and find() should all take logarithmic time or better.

For example, if one of the connected components is {1,2,6,9}, then the find() method should 
return 9 for each of the four elements in the connected components.
